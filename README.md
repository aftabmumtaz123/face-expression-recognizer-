   git clone https://github.com/aftabmumtaz123/face-expression-recognizer.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   cd face-expression-recognizer
   npm install face-api.js
   ```

3. **Download Face API models:**

   Download the Face API models from [invalid URL removed] and place them in the `models` directory of your project.

**Usage:**

1. **Start a web server:**
